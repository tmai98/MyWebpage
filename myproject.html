	My name is Thomas Cody and I am currently pursuing a Mechanical Engineering student at the University of North Carolina 
	at Charlotte. My partners and I have been working to solve the age-old problem of dirty pools. Growing up I my neighborhood 
	pool always had dirt and debris on the surface of the pool and this group felt there was a pressing need for a product that 
	can skim the surface and clean off the debris. We used the skills that we learned to create this seamless design and hope 
	that will float across the surface of any pool. A clean pool is a happy pool.

	My name is Tien Mai and I am part of this collaboration project called “Automated Black Skimmer”. I am a Mechanical 
	Engineering student working towards a Bachelors in Mechanical Engineering degree with a concentration in Motorsports. 
	Me and my partners, Trevor and Thomas wanted to make something that was easy to use, simple to repair, and aesthetically 
	good to look at while actually working. We formed this group to come up with all of that in a form of a pool skimmer. 
	The purpose of the pool skimmer is to clean the top of the pool but we wanted more than that. I wanted it to be practical 
	and easy to use. Our goal is to make our customers happy and we want these pools to be cleaned. Clean pools mean better summer, 
	and a good summer means a happy life.

	summer. Once Tien, Thomas, and I created the Automated Black Skimmer Dispensary company we where able to accomplish 
	our goal of creating an affordable device that can efficiently clean a pool. My goal is now to ensure every pool owner

		<center><p><b><u> The product </p></b></u></center>
		<center> Are you tired of putting in tedious labor to manually clean your pool? If so the Automated Black Skimmer is the solution for you. The 
		ABS is a revolutionary device that will save you time, money, and most importantly keep your pool in pristine condition without the 
		hassle of doing so by hand. The ABS is warranty guaranteed to keep clean your pool efficiently and effectively with very little to no 
		upkeep required. Thanks to our patented design the ABS has numerous operational advantages making it the top of the market. The 
		ABS’ patented plastic polymer construction ensures it is both lighter and more durable than its competitors. The ABS’ streamlined 
		designed ensures it will be extremely easy to dissemble in the case you would need to replace any of its operational parts. The ABS 
		has a user friendly design making it easy to reload the chlorine tablets and empty the waste collection basket for any user. The ABS’ 
		integration of advanced automated electronic systems allows for easily selectable preprogramed cleaning. The ABS’ solar panel and 
		integrated power system allows for the ABS to recharge with natural and artificial light ensuring the battery stays charged. The ABS’ 
		control mainframe allows the CPU to communicate the devices different sensors to ensure the pool skimmer is using the correct 
		chlorine tablet based on your pool’s content of chlorine and moving in the right positional pattern to filter your pools water without  any 
		inefficiencies in its actionable course. Another additional advantage to mention is that there are two vacuum ports you can utilize so 
		one can be used to connect to a second bottom line to clean the bottom of your pool utilizing our companies second and newest 
		product the Crab Crawler. The crab Crawler is based of the design of the ABS but is altered to utilize the same mechanisms that make 
		he ABS so effective at cleaning the surface of your pool to roam, cleanse and collect waste at the bottom of your pool. You won’t want 
		to clean your pool without the modern marvel that is the ABS. <br>

		<b><u>ABS Device functionality</u></b><br>
		The paragraph below will explain how yours ABS system is able to operate and what features and mechanisms allow it to clean your pool effectively
		and efficiently. The body of the ABS is 16 inches in diameter and 7-inch-thick cylindrical prism comprised of our patented top of the line injection 
		molded plastic polymer give the ABS system physical resilience, structural strength and stability, as well as flexibility and durability over time 
		and in different environmental conditions. The ABS maintain buoyancy via a buoy ring located around its base. The ABS come equipped with multiple sensor 
		systems. A laser sensor measures the volume of waste in the waste basket allowing the CPU to predict when you should unload the basket. A chlorine 
		sensor measures the chlorine levels of the pool allowing the CPU to assign which chlorine tablet is to be dispensed and at what rate. A positional sensor
		system allows the CPU of the ABS to refine its operational course to maximize pool cleansing. The chlorine tablet dispensary system works utilizing 2 magazines
		and 3 pistons. The 2 magazines are sized to hold either the 5-inch 3-inch diameter chlorine tablets. The magazines are loaded from the top via screw in lids and 
		are held at the ready by a spring-based pressure plate. A piston pushes the tablet selected by the CPU into a central channel where it is then pushed out of the
		ABS and into the pool through a hinged release door via a second central piston that works in conjunction with the first piston based on electronic motor control 
		coordinated by the CPU. This happens the same way for both pistons located near the two magazines. The ABS collect trash from the pool by sucking up water via the 
		pressure differential created by the attached vacuum line. The pool water is then brought in though a canal near the outside of the ABS’s bottom. The water 
		then flows back down through the waste basket leaving any trash. The ABS also have a second vacuum line attached to the Crab Crawler to clean the bottom of your pool. 
		The ABS have an integrated electric power grid compromised of motors and sensors but is focused around a solar panel and recharging battery core at the top of the 
		ABS which is controlled and regulated by the CPU which has a human interface on the control module at the top of the ABS. The ABS also have the capacity to 
		send messages to Bluetooth linked devices alerting you to the need of maintenance ensuring your ABS device runs smoothly continuing to clean your pool effectively and 
		efficiently. <br>
